The aggregation in this example shouldn't cause so great an overhead.
The number of spath facts is the same with the number of path facts
(i.e. each spath is the minimum path in a set of *one* path).


Without aggregation
./run
------------- graph.lb -------------
created workspace 'unique_workspace_2013-07-29-11-03-19'
added block 'block_1Z1IXBWX'

  40000000: path
